3. introduction: nonlinear dimensionality reduction

	a. embedding high-dimensional data into a space of two or three dimensions:
		it models each high-dimensional object by a two- or three-dimensional point in such a way that similar objects are modeled by nearby points and dissimilar objects are modeled by distant points.
	b. two main stages:
		b1. t-SNE constructs a probability distribution over pairs of high-dimensional objects in such a way that similar objects have a high probability of being picked
		b2. t-SNE defines a similar probability distribution over the points in the low-dimensional map, and it minimizes the Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence between the two distributions with respect to the locations of the points in the map.

	
	c. preserve small pairwise distance
